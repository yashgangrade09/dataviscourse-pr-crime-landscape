# TODOs

## Simple tasks:
* Make crime selection functional.
* Implement loading screen while the data is not displayed to give a visual indicator to user.
* Make chart loading sequential.
* Coordinate different views in the stats bar and doughnut chart. Ref: https://codepen.io/shivabhusal/pen/XazwVq?editors=1010
* Make processed data smaller (remove Case no, `SLC UT` string from address, keep either mm/dd/year or mm, dd, year). Remove crimes that we are not supporting. Maybe select 101-5 crimes that we intend to supporting
* Host on github.io
* Process book
* Create video
* Limit to Assault, Burglary-Robbery-Larceny, Damaged Prop, Drugs, DUI, Hit and Run, Homicide, Kidnap, Sexual assault- offense, traffic, weapons

## Trickier and optional tasks:
* Violent vs non-violent crimes.
* Data filtering using radial range selector.
* Treemap of all crimes.
* Month slider.
